              <p _ngcontent-iex-c39="" class="page-header-ui-text mb-5">The core focus of the project was to redesign
                the Department of Labor's website to address user challenges in efficiently finding the resources they
                need. These challenges included a crowded and elongated menu that made it cumbersome for users to access
                items located below the fold. My contributions in defining user flows, conducting card sorting
                exercises, and participating in sitemap development were instrumental in improving user navigation and
                content accessibility. We prioritized the menu navigation, recognizing it as the primary point of
                interaction for users. Through card sorting and usability testing we were able to simplfy the navigation
                menu and tailor it to the different audiences that would most frequently visit the page. </p>

            <p>The DOL's mission is to foster, promote, and develop the welfare of the wage earners, job seekers, and

            <h2>Why</h2>
            <p>The project centered on the redesign of the Department of Labor (DOL) website, with a primary focus on
              enhancing the navigation menu. The DOL website contained a vast amount of valuable information, but the
              existing navigation presented challenges for users. Specifically, the navigation menu extended below the
              fold, making it challenging for users to access critical content. Furthermore, there was a lack of clear
              content grouping and prioritization, beyond broad categories like "Topics" and "Agencies." This project
              aimed to address these usability issues and provide an improved user experience for visitors to the DOL
              website.</p>

            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p>In the early stages of this project, we conducted user interviews using the original site as a reference
              point to gain insights into the user experience. Our primary user persona, Rosemary, was the central
              figure in our design process. Her specific needs included easy access to information about SPA events, the
              ability to sign up her class or school to participate in the parade, insight into budget allocation, and a
              desire to engage with the organization. Additionally, we conducted a heuristic evaluation to identify
              usability issues and design flaws within the existing website. A key contribution I made was leading a
              competitive analysis, which, along with insights from low-fidelity usability tests, allowed us to
              prioritize updates to align with both stakeholder and user needs. Throughout the project, Rosemary's
              unique needs and pain points guided our design decisions, ensuring that the redesigned website effectively
              addressed critical issues and catered to the preferences of users like her.</p>

            <h2>Definition & Synthesis</h2>
            <p>Our user research process was comprehensive and focused on enhancing the DOL website's user experience.
              Key components included:</p>

            <p>Proto-Persona: We developed a proto-persona to gain a better understanding of our target audience. This
              proto-persona represented an archetype of our typical website user, allowing us to design with their needs
              in mind.</p>

            <p>User Paths Definition: We defined clear user paths, which were the optimal routes for users to access
              information. These paths served as the basis for improving navigation and content accessibility.</p>

            <p>Usability Testing: To validate our design decisions and user paths, we conducted usability tests. This
              involved observing real users interacting with the website to identify pain points and areas for
              improvement.</p>

            <p>Quadrant Analysis: After conducting usability tests, we created a quadrant analysis, plotting
              improvements based on two dimensions: user importance (X-axis) and DOL importance (Y-axis). This approach
              allowed us to prioritize enhancements, focusing on changes that mattered most to users and aligned with
              the DOL's objectives. </p>

            <p>This user research process provided valuable insights and data-driven guidance for our redesign efforts,
              ensuring that the changes made were both user-centric and aligned with the DOL's mission.</p>

          <div class="h-100 p-5 bg-body-tertiary border rounded-3">
            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <p>In the absence of site analytics and direct collaboration with the DOL (as this was a class assignment),
              our ideation process primarily relied on our own assessments and the usability tests we conducted. To
              better understand our users' needs and preferences, we employed the following methods:</p>

            <p>User-Centric Exploration: We conducted user interviews, surveys, and usability tests to gain insights
              into user preferences and pain points. These activities allowed us to understand how users interacted with
              the website, despite the absence of site analytics.</p>

            <p>Card Sorting and Information Architecture: Through card sorting exercises, we probed how users naturally
              grouped and categorized content. This exercise was pivotal in shaping the information architecture and
              optimizing the menu navigation, based on the information we had at hand.</p>

            <p>Content Prioritization: In our ideation process, we deliberated the separation of content for employers
              and non-employers, including workers and the unemployed. Although we didn't have direct access to site
              analytics, we prioritized content organization based on our own assessment and understanding of user
              importance and relevance.</p>

            <p>Navigation Styles: We also explored different navigation styles, specifically debating between side
              navigation and traditional top navigation. Our choices were guided by what we perceived as user-friendly,
              taking into account our usability test findings.</p>

            <h2>Prototyping</h2>
            <p>Our prototyping process began with user flow creation and low-fidelity digital prototyping, progressing
              into high-fidelity prototyping. We focused on enhancing menu button names for clarity and developed a
              visual design system for a cohesive user interface.</p>

            <p>We created a user flow based on the results from our user flow tests, aiming to ensure a logical and
              efficient path for users to access information on the DOL website. We then transitioned to a low-fidelity
              digital prototype. This prototype was used in usability tests to assess the effectiveness of our
              navigation and menu button names. We made adjustments to enhance clarity and usability based on user
              feedback.</p>

            <p>We developed a visual design system inspired by a mood board for styling, ensuring a cohesive and
              visually appealing user interface. Using our style guide we developed a hi-fi prototype, providing a
              visual representation of our proposed changes to the DOL website.</p>
